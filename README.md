# 🐱 CatApiKarate

A lightweight, BDD-style API test suite for the [Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/) using the [Karate](https://karatelabs.github.io/karate/) framework. This project demonstrates how to write expressive, maintainable, and data-driven API tests with minimal setup.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Simple Gherkin-based syntax
- ✅ Built-in HTTP, JSON, and XML support
- ✅ Parallel test execution
- ✅ Rich HTML reporting
- ✅ No Java code or step definitions required
- ✅ Easy CI/CD integration

## 🧪 How to Run the Tests

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven 3.6+

### Run Tests

```bash
mvn test
```


After execution, reports are generated at:

```
target/karate-reports/
```

Open `karate-summary.html` in your browser to view the results.

## 🧰 Dependencies

Key dependencies in `pom.xml`:

- `karate-junit5`: Core Karate testing framework
- `karate-apache`: Optional for advanced HTTP client features

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

Karate tests can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines. For example, in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Run Karate Tests
  run: mvn test
```

## 📈 Test Coverage

While Karate doesn't provide built-in test coverage reports, you can use external tools to analyze coverage. For instance, comparing `karate.log` to an OpenAPI/Swagger spec can help assess endpoint coverage.

## 💡 Improvement Suggestions

- **Add Tags to Scenarios**: Use tags like `@smoke`, `@regression`, etc., to categorize tests.
- **Parameterize Tests**: Utilize Karate's data-driven testing capabilities to run scenarios with multiple data sets.
- **Mock External Services**: If the Cat API has rate limits, consider mocking responses for consistent testing.
- **Integrate with Allure Reports**: For more detailed reporting, integrate Karate with Allure.
